    DOCTYPE html is the first line of code in an HTML document. 
    It tells the browser what type of document it is looking at. 
    In this case, it is an HTML document. 
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!--
    The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page.
    It contains all the content on the page.
-->
<html>
  <!--
        The <head> element contains meta information about the document.
        It is not displayed on the page. 
    -->
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
    <title>html&css</title>
    <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
  </head>
  <!--
        The <body> element contains all the content that is displayed on the page.

<!--
    HTML ELEMENTS (TAGS)
    HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages.
    HTML elements are represented by tags.
    HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on.
    Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page.

<!--
    Nesting Elements
    Nesting elements means putting elements inside other elements.
    For example, the <head> element is inside the <html> element.
    The <title> element is inside the <head> element.
    The <h1> element is inside the <body> element.
    The <body> element is inside the ___________ element.
-->

<!--
    Semantic Elements
    Semantic elements are elements that have a meaning.
    For example, the <h1> element is a semantic element because it defines a large heading.
    The <div> element is not a semantic element because it does not define the content it contains.

    ** try to use semantic elements instead of divs **
    ** good for seo, search engines can find what they need to more easily **



    Why use semantic elements?
    - Search engines can use semantic elements to better understand the content of a page.
    - Semantic elements can make your HTML easier to read and understand.
    - Semantic elements have greater accessibilty.
